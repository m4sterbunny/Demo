Rationale
---------

This site acts as a showcase for my technical writing. Some clients do not expose my work to the public. Also, potential clients like to see demos that fit with their style guides. This is my simple solution to showcasing.

Note that the API examples link out to another site. This achieves to objectives:
1) It demonstrates my markdown capabilities
2) The site consumes API data and displays that in a user-friendly manner (more user friendly than current read the docs offerings!)


Static Site Skills
******************

This site is written in reStructured Text which is rendered as HTML. My `portfolio <pages/portfolio.html>`_ includes links to a Slate built site, which uses markdown to render HTML.
