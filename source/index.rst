Rationale
---------

This site acts as a showcase for my technical writing. Showcasing can be a challenge. Many clients have access management, meaning that the documentation I assisted with is only available to their clients.

Some clients want to keep their writer a secret and never admit that they brought in a freelancer, or they do not want to admit your contribution. I learnt this early in my consulting career when I undertook a large report triage project in which I brought in an analyst to conduct the statistics and a researcher to verify the quoted data. I personally compiled and edited the report and wrote entire sections, including the recommendations, and my acknowledged role: editor! Sometimes it is simply too politically delicate to admit why you needed your freelancer.

Thankfully not all clients are complicated and there are some examples in the "wild" that are publicly available.

Note that the API examples link out to another site. This achieves to objectives:
1) It demonstrates my markdown capabilities
2) The site consumes API data and displays that in a user-friendly manner (more user friendly than current read the docs offerings!)


Static Site Skills
