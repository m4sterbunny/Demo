Rationale
---------

This site acts as a showcase for my technical writing. Showcasing can be a challenge. Many clients have access management, meaning that the documentation I assisted with is only available to their clients.

Some clients want to keep their writer a secret and never admit that they brought in a freelancer, or they do not want to admit your contribution. I learnt this early in my consulting career when I undertook a large report triage project in which I brought in an and collaborated with an analyst to conduct the statistics and a researcher to verify the quoted data. I personally compiled and edited the report and wrote entire sections, including the recommendations, and my acknowledged role: editor! Sometimes it is simply too politically delicate to admit why you needed your freelancer.

Thankfully not all clients are complicated and there are some examples in the "wild" that are publicly available.


Static Site Skills
******************

This site is written in reStructured Text (rST) which is rendered as HTML.

The `portfolio <pages/portfolio.html>`_ includes links to a Slate site, which uses markdown to render HTML. This achieves to objectives:
1) It demonstrates my markdown capabilities.
2) The site consumes API data and displays that in a user-friendly manner (more user friendly than current read the docs offerings!).

Most customers I work with in documentation projects prefer tools that consume files in Markdown and, for APIs, YAML/Markdown blends. I tend to simply use my favorite notepad tool, Sublime to work the docs.

I work like a dev: I push and pull to GitHub *et al*. I collaborate on reviews on PRs.

I like to hack file management by applying metadata/front matter to files. (Although, I recently got stung by GitBook and Stoplight with my quick-n-dirty hacks. GitBook killed my front matter with a recent release and my HTML wip comments containing ":" killed Stoplight's  -- thankfully support at both were ... supportive!).
