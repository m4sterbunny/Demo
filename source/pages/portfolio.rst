Documentation
-------------

Showcasing can be a challenge. Many clients have access management, meaning that the documentation that I assisted with is available to their clients only. Happily, there are examples in the "wild" that are publicly available.

API Documentation Links
-----------------------
- Upstart_ Commerce public API docs
- Faria_ private API docs
- smtp2go_ wip API (will be public)
- cloudRF_ wip API (will be public)

See more about these :ref:`API projects` and others below and via their links above.

User Guide Documentation Links
-------------------------------

Of all the material I assist to create, user documentation is probably the most likely to not be publicly accessible. I have just two snippets to expose for now:

- Allelica_
- Braze_

Editing
-------

Books
*****

With a PhD in Biology and an undergraduate degree in parasitology, I guess it is no surprise that Daniel from `Parasites without Borders <http://parasiteswithoutborders.com/books/>`_ reached out to ask me to edit in the medical field. I still occasionally have time to assist with papers and PhD edits.

This book_ edit of Parasitic Diseases was a very interesting gig. It required that I recruit and manage a linguist for pronunciation guide, assist Daniel with the clinical appendix (a new item for Edition 7 of this text). Also, I took on responsibility for indexing; this required that I identify and consolidate duplicates. When we quite literally ground InDesign's indexing option to a halt, I identified an alternative that consumed the pdf. Despite being a supported, paid for option, I recruited someone with python skills to customize a couple of scripts for us to provide the outcome we needed. All in all a great experience.

Web Content Review
*******************

Several clients have created cross-over projects along the lines of: "would you also be able to take a look at ...". Often this request includes a content review of existing or upcoming web content.

Alternatively, clients often have internal subject matter experts who write and want to improve the copy prior to it going public.

   * - Soho
     - Soho Dragon are a Microsoft Development house based in NY. Peter had hoped to engage me for a documentation gig, and with the client being unresponsive, put me to work on his site instead. I improved the SEO using YOAST and tidied up the language. I have also improved presentations such as capacity statements for bids.

API Projects
------------

Upstart Commerce
****************

I cleaned up the YAML/Swagger to ensure that the API is described correctly and assists the user effectively. I also "proofed", i.e. I fixed those issues that effect quality such as ensuring consistency of the English language variant and style applied.

Upstart_ Commerce have their Open API 3.0 documentation publicly available. This is one of the larger API sets that I cleaned up. Working with the Russian dev team across Slack, the docs are now fully compliant and consistent (US English).

Faria
*****

The largest API set that I have cleaned is for Faria, for whom I cleaned multiple APIs. There is no intention to make these API documents publicly available. I have, therefore, provided a brief introduction and exposed the smallest possible Faria_ endpoint.

The docs are now fully compliant and consistent (US English for the APIs, UK English for the high-level client support documentation).

SMTP2GO
*******

These docs will be publicly available. The work-in-progress for smtp2go requires further frontend work. In the meantime, I provided a brief introduction and exposed an smtp2go_ endpoint.

Cloud RF
********

Cloud RF have the most specialized technical topic that I have covered thus far. My life experience has exposed me to eCommerce (Upstart), school administration (Faria), and email marketing (smtp2go). This eased my assisting clients in these areas. I do not, however, have radio mapping skills.

This knowledge challenge was not a barrier to my cleaning the API set and ensuring that it was compliant. It simply required a tighter coms cycle which we achieved using PR comments on GitHub.

I did, however, step away from the high-level documentation as my naivety in Radio propagation mapping meant I was not the best person to provide the high-level docs. I set up the documentation site structure and the page structure and populated the pages with the base information and links. This left the client in a position to complete the high-level documentation internally.

Cloud RFs API will be publicly available, in the meantime, I provide a brief introduction and exposed a cloudRF_ endpoint.


Cybertonica
***********

Cybertonica's API is private to their clients and for good reason. They are dealing in the world of threat analyses. I assisted with a high-level customer integration document for a REST and SOAP API pair that may be accessed directly from JS plugins.

After that, I assisted with the API for the Shopify dashboard that provides similar threat analyses.

I am not able to expose this project further!

Distributed Devs
****************

Distributed Devs engaged me to write up an API for handover to other development teams. I took a less formal approach to allow this to be a much smaller investment and kept all the details in the Readme of the related repositories. Pleased with my efficiencies, they engaged me for other projects such as high-level architecture documentation for products supporting the insurance sector. Again, I am under NDAs and can not expose more about this client!
