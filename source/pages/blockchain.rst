User Docs
---------

For `StarkWare`_ I have edited large components of the StarkExV3_ documentation. Writing in Markdown; building in GitBook.

I have also refactored these Cairo_ docs for StarkNet_, now if only the devs would actually merge the PR! Writing in rST; building with Sphinx/Read the Docs.

For `TX Labs`_ I have worked with one of their developers to introduce how to request and assign service nodes. Writing in Markdown; building in GitBook.
