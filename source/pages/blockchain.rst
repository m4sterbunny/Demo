User Docs
---------

For StarkWare, I have edited large components of the StarkExV3_ documentation. Writing in Markdown; building in GitBook.

I have also refactored these Cairo_ docs for StarkNet_; now if only the devs would actually merge the PR! Writing in rST; building with Sphinx/Read the Docs.

For `TX Labs`_, I have worked with one of their developers to introduce how to request and assign service nodes. Writing in Markdown; building in GitBook.

For Ethereum's docs, I improved the description around reorgs (see `PR <https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pull/3267>`_).
