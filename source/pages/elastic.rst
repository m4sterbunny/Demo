   * - Role
     - Competency
     - Example/s
   * - Write user documentation
     - Created markdown and rST ((restructured text) user docs for SaaS.
     - `Examples <https://demo-zoom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/portfolio.html#user-guide-documentation>`_ include Allelica (markdown) and Gilytics rST.
   * -
     - Reviewing technical documentation
     - e.g. edit of Stark's Cairo and StarkEx documentation (rST and markdown, respectively). Improved scaffolding and navigation, simplified language (Israeli dev team).
   * -
     - `Reviewing and maintaining API documentation <https://demo-zoom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/portfolio.html#api-documentation>`_ (specifications and high-level overviews)
     - Multiple examples in showcase. Clients from New Zealand, US, Russia, Ukraine, India, Canada, UK. Often distributed teams with managers in one region and devs in another.
   * - Edit developer drafts
     - SaaS documentation - I was brought in to assist the team to apply a new style guide.
     - Braze_
   * - Stand up for the user and champion the importance of good documentation and user-facing content internally and externally.
     - As an ex-teacher and naive user of the tool, I advocate for the intended audience.
     - Example: Rappi. The lead dev had a very wordy style. I had to advocate for the use of images, TL:DRs, and other scaffolding devices to assist the user to navigate the content.
   * - Lead and contribute to important team projects focussed on improving overall documentation quality and processes
     - As part of a small team (myself as writer and approx. 10 devs), I encouraged cross-product dev teams to instigate CICD for documentation.
     - For `Faria <https://m4sterbunny.github.io/build/#client-3-faria>`_, I identified the Ruby tool to autogenerate the "Swagger", shared the best practices to allow this tool to be implemented on 4 individual repos, by 4 different teams. I motivated for the teams to pass their autogenerated docs downstream to my static site and set up the webhooks to ensure that any upstream changes resulted in downstream documentation updates (with linting to validate the spec before publishing).

Looking For

.. list-table:: What We’re Looking For
   :widths: 50 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Desired
     - Alignment
     - URL
   * - Impeccable writing and editing skills, and an open approach to peer reviews
     - I have over 5 years experience as a technical writer. I work with marketing teams and technical teams. I write and I edit other authors' work both in the technical space, and in the medical space, such as this `clinical textbook <https://parasiteswithoutborders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PD7thEditionHighResVersion5-11-2019.pdf>`_.
     - `Examples provided <https://demo-zoom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/portfolio.html#content-review>`_
   * - Technical interest and aptitude — you like learning new things and enjoy simplifying complexity
     - I am a biologist who wandered off into tech because I find understanding new tech interesting. I firmly hold to the medical training profession's see one, do one, teach one (as long as I am not one of the patients in that flow!). I applied this principle to achieve my GCP ACE qualification by supporting my cohort to achieve the ACE challenges once I understood enough to share.
     - `See the credential <https://www.credential.net/7d230a28-b21f-4fe3-8880-5a272652d0c9?key=>`_
   * - Proven experience delivering quality documentation within a fast-paced software development environment.
     - As a freelancer on two dollar escrow platforms, "fast-paced" does not even come close to describing it. In some weeks, I may onboard with multiple teams. I have to come in via IMs such as Slack, access and orientate to repositories, and make an effective impact within less than 5 hours. If I don't, then I would not be sitting on a 90+% reputation on Upwork, with 80+% of my past clients saying that they would recommend me! And, with regards to the other 20%, unless you have experience of such a platform, you probably have no idea, and I would need lots of tea and time to tap you in!
     - I am afraid that the exterior view to my portfolio on `Upwork <https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0111e0b1f1b6c5d8d4?s=1017484851352698996>`_ is a terrible lens; they restrict access to the majority of my work. Signing up as an "employer" is simple and should give you deeper access to my gigs and client feedback. Please also see my recommendations on `LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/harriebickle/>`_.
   * - Ability to work effectively using build scripts to publish Markdown or Asciidoctor content within GitHub workflows
     - I use static site builds in both Markdown and reStructured text. To do this, I customise my Ubuntu environment using a Windows 10 machine with a Linux kernel.
     - e.g. Slate -- Markdown, Sphinx -- rST
   * - Passion and drive, with a strong desire to make things better for users.
     - My (many) API documentation gigs are a great example of how I carry the torch on behalf of the user and must maintain my internal motivation to drive the project that others consider "done". Where the model is: develop the API and then document it, the devs are often on new scrums by the time I come in. I need to engage the dev community I work with, outside of the "measurable" input time, to ensure that the documentation supports the user. And, I need to do this at a fine-toothed-comb level.
     -
   * - A great attitude towards collaboration and teamwork — the best docs are produced by great teams
     - I have joined and worked with remote teams across 6 continents, thanks to freelancing. I am simply part of the SDL.
     - See my `Upwork <https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0111e0b1f1b6c5d8d4?s=1017484851352698996>`_  feedback and `LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/harriebickle/>`_ recommendations.
   * - Experience working on complex products or systems — any observability/monitoring or Elastic knowledge would be a double bonus.
     - Novice user of GCP. Assisted with documenting an AWS redshift integration. I pretty much learn what I am pointed at!
     - Used Stackdriver with the GCP, CloudRadar's product, and documented ETLeap's AWS redshift integration.
   * - Interest and/or experience helping to improve documentation workflows, tooling, and content.
     - As mentioned above, I have take a distributed dev team from 0 docs to a full CICD pipeline for API documentation. I often look at a client's requirements and make recommendations for tooling.
     - CICD and tooling, e.g. Faria group.
   * - Passion for contributing to open source projects or communities.
     - As I work for the dollar, on the clock, I do not have much time for (more) deviations. I did recently contribute to the Ethereum docs when I popped by to swot up for a current role.
     - Role: Stark editor. Contribution: `Ethereum <https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pull/3267/files>`_
