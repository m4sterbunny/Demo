Dear potential client,

I am an experienced technical writer and I suspect that I may be particularly well placed to assist you with your writing needs. I have a firm grounding in blockchain and DeFi as Stark's editor and I have been commissioned to write blockchain-related articles independently. I also have a good understanding of Machine Learning. 

My cloud experience is largely in GCP (I am ACE-certified), but I have had exposure to AWS, for example, I assisted etleap with their SAAS user documentation for their AWS Redshift integration. This project is a good example of my typical workflow: I communicated with the team across Slack, wrote in Markdown, and submitted my work for review via GitHub PRs. I responded to the review cycles and my work was merged. The work included annotated screenshots of etleap's SAAS and the AWS GUI.

I have a classical understanding of statistics myself (qualified with a Biology PhD) and before I left South Africa recently, I was a registered vendor for both the University of Cape Town and Cape Peninsula University of Technology to provide statistical analytics and editing of data-driven reports. I consider myself a glorified cleaner in many of my roles; especially so when it comes to preparing data for analyses!

I am experienced in creating technical white papers, technical documentation,  User Guides, Integration Guides, API Developer Guides, and In-Platform documentation. I maintain a deep empathy for the intended audience. For documentation, white papers, and reports, I work with creatives such as graphic designers to develop illustrations that support the user in their understanding of concepts. I also work with marketing teams and development teams. Personally, I have been a software tester, systems design analyst, and data manager in permanent roles for startups.

If you agree that I am well placed to augment your team by bringing these competencies aboard, then I look forward to meeting you and learning more about your requirements.

Regards
Harrie
