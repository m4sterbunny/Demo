.. list-table:: Case Studies
   :widths: 25 50 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Role
     - Competency
     - Example/s
   * - Responsible for creating, reviewing and maintaining high quality technical documentation and training materials for the global IT team and wider development teams.
     - Created markdown content in Confluence to document best practices for a distributed IT team.
     - Faria (Ruby dev team in Russia, Taiwan, and US)
   * -
     - Reviewing technical documentation
     - Edited Stark's Cairo and StarkEx documentation (rST and markdown respectively). Improved scaffolding and navigation, simplified language (Israeli dev team).
   * -
     - Reviewing/maintaining API documentation (specifications and high-level overviews)
     - Multiple examples in showcase. Clients from NewZealand, US, Russia, Ukraine, India, Canada, UK. Often distributed teams with marketing in one region and devs in another.
   * - Creating high quality training materials, including written and video content.
     - Big fan of TechSmith / Camtasia for video recording. Experience editing video content for brief, informative micro-content.
     - TravelWits SaaS documentation for FAQ & decade of teaching high-school science.
   * - Providing technical documentation support within IT, helping others in the global IT team with their Documentation needs.
     - As a freelancer, I often join teams from two extremes. Either I am the most experienced in documentation and support the team in selecting and applying toolsets and methodologies. Or, I am the least experienced member and have to peddle to catch up with existing toolsets and methodologies.
     - Most experienced, e.g., CareDove API my knowledge of Stoplight and high-level documentation strategies was instrumental in progressing their project. Least experienced. e.g., Rappi had selected Docusaurus to support a multi-language client portal. While I was familiar in markdown, I had never supported a team in creating translated user documentation before. I worked closely with both the devs and the freelance translators who reworked my English documentation.
   * - Working with the global Technical Writing team to apply documentation standards and enhancements.
     - As a freelancer, I have only rarely worked with a technical writing team. Typically, I am the only writer on documentation projects. My team is usually the developers and/or marketing.
     - Braze_ is an exception to this, where I was brought in to assist the team to apply a new style guide.
   * - Collaborating with IT, Technical Writing, Tools, and other development teams to create innovative ways to share and automate documentation.
     - I have worked with 2 API dev teams to instigate CICD for documentation. One in ASP.net and the other in Ruby.
     - For both clients (Cybertonica and Faria), I worked around the code to formalise the API specification and ensure the descriptions supported the naive user. For Faria, I identified the Ruby tool to autogenerate the "Swagger", shared the best practices to allow this tool to be implemented on 4 individual repos, by 4 different teams. I motivated for the teams to pass their autogenerated docs downstream to my static site and setup the webhooks to ensure that any upstream changes resulted in downstream documentation updates (with linting to validate the spec before publishing).

Qualifications

.. list-table:: Qualification/Experience
   :widths: 25 50 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Experience
     - Alignment
     - URL
   * - A minimum of 2-3 years of experience creating written technical documentation, tutorials, and other training material. Examples must be provided with your application.
     - I have over 5 years of part-time experience as a technical writer. Before that, I was a high-school teacher. It is this role that shaped my deep empathy for the intended audience, taught me to scaffold information to make it accessible, and reinforced that different people accept information in different ways.

Skills
******

.. list-table:: Web Content & Article Editing
   :widths: 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Skills
     - Note
   * - Excellent documentation skills with high attention to detail.
     - I am afraid that the exterior view to my portfolio on `Upwork <https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0111e0b1f1b6c5d8d4?s=1017484851352698996>`_ is a terrible lens, they restrict access to the majority of my work. Signing up as an "employer" is simple and should give you deeper access to my client feedback. Please also see my recommendations on LinkedIn
   * - Experience creating training-oriented material, including both written and video content.
     - Yes – discussed above
   * - Experience working with Wiki-based media.
     - Yes – confluence example discussed above. I also consume Wikis to access content for reports. For example, to create a high-level overview of an Insurance system that implements AI on claimants' submissions to check for fraud on behalf of Distributed Devs.
   * - Impeccable English speaker with strong written and verbal communication skills.
     - The main reason that my technical writing is "part-time", is that I have a reputation as an editor and my other time is spent assisting a wide range of cients with their editing needs. While this does often cross back over into the technical field, it extends to medical and pharmacological texts also. I have a brain, and I am not afraid to use it!
   * - An ability to quickly grasp technical concepts and systems, and communicate them in a clear manner for the end-user.
     - I trust that my portfolio convinces you of this?!
   * - Knowledge of Windows enterprise business environment.
     - I use a Windows box myself. Back in the dot com boom (yes I am that old), I saved the CEO's data from a crashed Windows machine with DOS (please don't expect me to have a clue now!). I know bits and pieces, probably more than most due to having to edit PATHS and other such fiddly environment setups.
   * - Knowledge of or exposure to IT server hardware/software.
     - A wide range of software exposure. Back in the dot com boom/my startup days, I was the unofficial tech support. Every time a new colleague arrived, it was me in the patch room trying to locate a port to set them up and installing the software on their machine (please don't expect me to have a clue now!).
   * - Knowledge of or exposure to a data center environment.
     - As data manager at Freefund.com, I managed a small data input team. Seeing as we were stretching MS Access to its breaking point, I would not go so far as to call it a "data center environment", but many of the principles apply. I am ACE qualified on the GCP, and so have a good understanding of cloud data technologies. I also recently created user documentation for ETLeap to assist users to integrate their SaaS with AWS Redshift.
   * - Strong analytical skills coupled with the ability to operate in a fast-paced environment with evolving project requirements and priorities.
     - As a freelancer on two dollar escrow platforms, "fast-paced" and "evolving requirements" does not even come close to describing it. In some weeks I may onboard with multiple teams. I have to come on via IMs such as Slack, access and orientate to repositories, and make an effective impact within less than 5 hours. If I don't, then I would not be sitting on a 90+% reputation on Upwork with 80% of my past clients saying that they would recommend me! And, with regards to the other 20%, unless you have experience of such a platform, you probably have no idea and I would need lot's of tea and time to tap you in!
   * - Excellent communication skills with the ability to work as part of a team or individually as required.
     - If this is not yet coming across, then I am failing as a communicator!
   * - Motivated self-starter, who independently takes projects from planning through to completion.
     - Teaching, completing a PhD, freelancing across multiple continents, winning competitive tenders for NGO work. These all highlight both my ability to go it alone AND to work cooperatively in complex situations. See my recommendations on LinkedIn for detailed feedback in this regard.
   * - Knowledge of linux environment.
     - As mentioned, I am ACE qualified in the GCP which required linux and bash capabilities. I also use Windows 10 for its linux kernel and favour setting up my Ubuntu environment over the command line environment for static site builds and other tooling.
   * - Knowledge of mobile devices: iOS, iPadOS and Android.
     - Largely an Android user myself. Perhaps if you pay me more than my gigging does I will move to iOS. But I am the sensible type who focused on paying off their mortgage over buying the most expensive tech on the market!
   * - High proficiency with Microsoft Word and other MS Office packages.
     - I have and do use MS Office. I can wrangle data in Excel to an advanced level and use multiple advanced features in Word. But, really if you are ask me to be your technical writer, I am going to have some serious questions about whether MS Office is the best tooling for you.
   * - Experience with Photoshop or other image editing software.
     - While I do have some Photoshop experience, I don't spend money on Adobe. My clients occasionally do. For user documentation and image annotation, I have some very simple (and free) tooling options. But, telling you more would be giving away some of my trade secrets and hmm, I haven't even met you yet.
