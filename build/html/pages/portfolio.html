<h2>User Guide Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#user-guide-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Of all the material I create, user documentation is probably the most likely not to be publicly accessible. For example, I created Pathfinder’s SAAS documentation in rST (restructued text), making use of the glossary feature offered by Read the Docs. I provided annotated screen shots and detailed the funtion of various toolsets.</p>
<p>This SaaS documentation item is in review and is exposed from my account (with permission). It was written in Markdown in GitBook:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://technobunnies-1.gitbook.io/copy-saas/-M85k8TEdyvcendFtPm-/">Allelica</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>I often create high-level documentation to assist user understanding of the use cases for the API specification that I have created or edited. Such as this <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.algopix.com/docs/algopix-api-documentation/ZG9jOjE3ODE1Mjg3-how-to-use-the-async-api">high-level documentation for Algopix</a>.</p>
<p>Not only do I create user guides from scratch, but I also assist with editing the existing documents:</p>

<h3>Books &amp; Papers<a class="headerlink" href="#books-papers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With a PhD. in Biology and an undergraduate degree in parasitology, I guess it is no surprise that Daniel from <a class="reference external" href="http://parasiteswithoutborders.com/books/">Parasites without Borders</a> reached out to ask me to edit in the medical field.</p>
<p>This <a class="reference external" href="https://parasiteswithoutborders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PD7thEditionHighResVersion5-11-2019.pdf">book</a> edit of Parasitic Diseases was a very interesting gig. It required that I recruit and manage a linguist for pronunciation guide, assist Daniel with the clinical appendix (a new item for Edition 7 of this text). Also, I took on responsibility for indexing; this required that I identify and consolidate duplicates. When we quite literally ground InDesign’s indexing option to a halt, I identified an alternative that consumed the pdf. Despite being a supported, paid-for option, I recruited someone with python skills to customize a couple of scripts for us to provide the outcome we needed – all in all, a great experience.</p>
<p>I am the editor for several PhD.s and papers in the biology sphere. This is where I cut my editorial teeth before I became focused on technical writing – for example, this <a class="reference external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29726023/">paper</a> in pharmacology.</p>
<p>I was also involved in the NGO sector in South Africa. Here I assisted with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mietafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-evolving-role-of-21st-Century-Education-NGOs-in-South-Africa.pdf">research</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g0CogthUGGJ1sEZw43XeOqQwQ9AgOXIs/view">editing</a>: especially the editing of data-driven reports.</p>

<h3>Upstart Commerce<a class="headerlink" href="#upstart-commerce" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I cleaned up the YAML/Swagger to ensure that the API is described correctly and assists the user effectively. I also “proofed”, i.e. I fixed those issues that affect quality, such as ensuring consistency of the English language variant and style applied.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://apidocs.upstartcommerce.com/docs/api-docs/b3A6NzYxMDU-remove-credit-card">Upstart</a> Commerce have their Open API 3.0 documentation publicly available.

<h3>Faria<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The largest API set that I have cleaned is for Faria, for whom I cleaned multiple APIs. There is no intention to make these API documents publicly available. I have, therefore, provided a brief introduction and provide the smallest possible <a class="reference external" href="https://m4sterbunny.github.io/build/#client-3-faria">Faria</a> endpoint specification.</p>

<h3>SMTP2GO<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Initially, the documentation site was built in Redoc.ly. I edited and augmented the existing specification by working directly with the YAML. The team then moved to the single page site builder Slate. I worked with the developers across Asana, Slack, and GitHub until we had the functionality they required. The <a class="reference external" href="https://smtp2go.github.io/smtp2go.apidocs/#smtp2go-api">smtp2go</a> documentation is now live.</p>

<div class="section" id="cloud-rf">
<h3>Cloud RF<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-rf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cloud RF has the most specialized technical topic that I have covered thus far. My life experience has exposed me to eCommerce (Upstart), school administration (Faria), and email marketing (smtp2go). This eased my assisting clients in these areas. I do not, however, have radio mapping skills.</p>
<p>This knowledge challenge was not a barrier to my cleaning the API set and ensuring that it was compliant. It simply required a tighter coms cycle which we achieved using PR comments on GitHub.</p>
<p>I did, however, step away from the high-level documentation as my naivety in Radio propagation mapping meant I was not the best person to provide the high-level docs. I set up the documentation site structure and the page structure and populated the pages with the base information and links. This left the client in a position to complete the high-level documentation internally.</p>
<p>Cloud RFs API will be publicly available, in the meantime, I provide a brief introduction and describe a <a class="reference external" href="https://m4sterbunny.github.io/build/#client-1-cloud-rf">cloudRF</a> endpoint.</p>

<h3>Cybertonica<a class="headerlink" href="#cybertonica" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cybertonica’s API is private to their clients: for good reason. They are dealing in the world of threat analyses. I assisted with a high-level customer integration document for a REST and SOAP API pair that may be accessed directly from JS plugins.</p>

<h3>Distributed Devs<a class="headerlink" href="#distributed-devs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Distributed Devs engaged me to write up an API for handover to other development teams. I took a less formal approach to allow this to be a much smaller investment and kept all the details in the Readme of the related repositories. Pleased with my efficiencies, they engaged me for other projects such as high-level architecture documentation for products supporting the insurance sector applying AI tools on insurance claims. Again, I am under NDAs and can not expose more about this client.</p>

<h3>Caredove<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.caredove.com/">Caredove</a> engaged me to take over an API specification project (<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.caredove.com/docs/api-documentation/">caredoveAPI</a>). Caredove supports healthcare providers with a referral management system. The repo was in GitLab, and the spec rendered in Stoplight using JSON files. The original writer had been handed Postman tests and constructed the spec from the JSON.</p>
<p>To ensure that I did not interfere with existing users of the documentation, and to take advantage of Stoplight’s rendering of tags, I converted the JSON spec to a YAML file and worked that.</p>
<p>The YAML did not adhere to Open API 3.0 specification, so I used Spectral and Swagger’s editor to identify issues and fix them. For example, one endpoint had multiple functions – dependent upon the payload sent. I removed the previous writer’s “fix” (to present the path twice, once with a trailing /) and provided links from the specification to high-level documentation to support the user in understanding how the endpoint functioned and what payloads to provide.</p>
<p>Once the YAML could be consumed and rendered by Stoplight, I built up what I called pseudo-schemas. These schemas reflected example JSON payloads for endpoints that were missing their specification details. The reason I called them pseudo-schemas on each PR is that I am not a dev; I am a writer and, as such, believe that these should be validated (ideally by mocking a request with them; I didn’t have my own authentication).</p>
<p>I also mapped the relevant fields of these schemas back to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html">FHIR specification</a> that this endpoint is compliant with.</p>

<h3>Dairy Vets<a class="headerlink" href="#dairy-vets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Dairy Vets had a non-compliant API and were keen to get it to render in Redoc.ly. I worked it through Redoc.ly’s linter (with the lint requirements customised to “minimal”) until it was compliant enough to render. Where compromises were made to achieve this, I logged “conversations” on the PR in GitHub to prevent any issues being dropped.</p>
