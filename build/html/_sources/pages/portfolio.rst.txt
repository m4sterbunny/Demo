Documentation
-------------

Showcasing can be a challengeMany clients have access management, meaning that the documentation that I assisted with is available to their clients only. Happily, there are examples in the "wild" that are publically available.

API Documentation
-----------------

Upstart Commerce
****************

I clean up the YAML/Swagger to ensure that the API is decribed correctly and assists the user effectively. I also "proofed", i.e. I fixed those issues that effect quality such as ensuring consistency of the English language variant and style applied.

Upstart_ Commerce have their Open API 3.0 documentation publically available. This is one of the larger API sets that I cleaned up. Working with the Russian dev team across Slack, the docs are now fully compliant and consistent (US English).

Faria
*****

The largest API set that I have cleaned is for Faria, for whom I cleaned multiple APIs. There is no intention to make these API documents publically available. I have, therefore, provided a brief introduction and exposed the smallest possible Faria_ endpoint.

The docs are now fully compliant and consistent (US English for the APIs, UK English for the high-level client support documentation).

SMTP2GO
*******

These docs will be publically available. The work-in-progress for smtp2go requires further frontend work. In the meantime, I provided a brief introduction and exposed an smtp2go_ endpoint.

Cloud RF
********

Cloud RF have the most specialised technical topic that I have covered thus far. My life experience has exposed me to ecommerce (Upstart), school administration (Faria), and email marketing (smtp2go). I do not, however, have radio mapping skills.

This knowledge challenge was not a barrier to my cleaning the API set and ensuring that it was compliant. It simply required a tighter coms cycle which we achieved using PR comments on GitHub.

I did, however, step away from the high-level documentation as my naivety in Radio propagation mapping meant I was not the best person to provide the high-level docs. I set up the documentation site structure and the page structure and populated the pages with the base information and links. This left the client in a position to complete the high-level documentation internally.

Cloud RFs API will be publically available, in the meantime, I provided a brief introduction and exposed an cloudRF_ endpoint.
