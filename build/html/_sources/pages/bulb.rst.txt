Ready to Change a Light Bulb?
=============================


Preconditions
-------------

You will need:

- a typical room supported with electricity and electrical lighting

You may need:

- a ladder
- a small towel
- a replacement bulb


Step 1: Test your Circuit
-------------------------

Verify the light bulb requires changing by testing.

1.1 Test the local circuit by changing the switch position.

.. topic:: When is a switch set to on?

      .. image:: ../images/switch.png
         :width: 200
         :height: 250

   Typically, when the lowest edge touches the wall the circuit is complete, and the switch is "on". However, this is not a fixed rule. Do try both positions.

1.2 Test the wider circuit by ensuring that all the switches in your circuit breaker are aligned.

.. topic:: Circuit Breaker

   All properties with electricity have a control panel or circuit breaker. Locate this and inspect the switch positions. If some of those switches are in the opposite setting to others, align them.

If neither approach resolves the lack of light issue, then you need to access the bulb. You may need a ladder, towel, and replacement bulb for the next step.

Step 2: Test your Bulb
----------------------

.. warning:: Stay Safe

   Falls can be painful and result in injury. If the lightbulb is out of reach, ensure that you have access to a robust ladder with solid feet that will not slip.

   Incandescent light bulbs can get very hot. If you have an incandecent bulb that was recently lit, then use a small towel between it and your hand.

2.1 Set your light switch to the "off" position. If you are not sure of the position to use, apply the position shown in 1.1.

2.2 (Optional) Set up the ladder.

2.3 Ensuring that you have access to a replacement bulb and a towel (if the bulb is hot), locate and remove the suspect bulb. 

.. warning:: Safety First

   If you are using a ladder, it is better to climb down and place the suspect bulb somewhere safe than to attempt to handle both bulbs.

   Broken bulbs can cut, and modern "energy-saving" bulbs contain toxic mercury.


2.4 Replace the suspect bulb with a new bulb and test it by returning the switch to the on position. If the issue was a dud bulb, then you now have a working light.

2.5 Dispose of the old bulb safely.

.. topic:: Disposal

   Incandescent bulbs may be wrapped in old paper and placed in the trash. Energy-saving bulbs must be handed into a recyling centre capable of processing mercury.
